# Farmburg-A-B-Testing

**Purpose:** For Codecademy Coaches application! Please run the iPython notebook for all methods (provided by Codeacademy) and results.

**Goal of the project:** Using statistical tests (Chi-Squared test, Binomial test) to evaluate the most effective price points for microtransactions for a hypothetical company (Farmburg). Although the Chi-Squared test showed that the most customers would purchase a micro-transaction at $.99, we concluded that the most effective price point would be $4.99 given the results of the Binomial test.
